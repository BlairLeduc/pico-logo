# Colour Palette for Pico Logo

Each row is one hue group from `palette_24bit` (see `devices/palette.h`). The number on each block is the index into that array (0–255). This follows the palette from the Atari 8‑bit GTIA.

Below is an SVG rendering of the full 256-colour palette. GitHub will render the SVG inline so the palette appears the same for all viewers.

Notes:
- I converted the original inline HTML blocks into an SVG so GitHub's sanitizer won't remove the styling.
- The SVG is stored next to this file as `Colours.svg`. If you prefer a raster PNG, I can also generate one.
